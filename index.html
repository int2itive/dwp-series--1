           <p>The mechanics of our reality, is not in our hands, it is in our beliefs. Life is a choice we have been told, as long as we choose from the options given to us by the creators of the story.</p>
           <p>Guilt, fear, worship, the giving of yourself and hope, are the path on the road to nowhere. As heaven and hell are just enjoyed or disliked memories in our minds. The true path has always been an internal one.</p>
           <p>The mechanics of reality has only ever been in our minds, as the spirit within us has been the energy behind our experience of this reality.</p>
           <p>As the observer cannot observe itself, what you see is not you, it is merely what you have created in your mind to try and make sense of what you think.</p>
           <p>We create movies in our mind to enable us to design what we are going to do next. It has only been a waking dream, used by our minds, which we now refer to as our lives.</p>
           <p>Religion and most forms of spirituality, when focused on external gods or deities are teaching you to worship and not how to access the essence that is you. We are the observer, observing our thoughts, in our reality dreams, created within ourselves. The true understanding is within, as you begin to believe in you and not anything else.</p>
           <p>You must own your mind as that is your true wealth. The true holy books are the understandings of the processes of hearing, smelling, seeing, touching and the creation of your feelings. The intelligence behind you being able to create those experiences, are just part of your huge number of abilities within, not appreciated yet, that all come together and enable you to create in your mind within what you call your life</p>
           <p>It has always been simple, you are the observer who cannot observe yourself, you can only observe your creations. That is why we refer to you as the creator or another word, God.</p>

          <p>As a stage manager, you are the logistics head of the body, making sure everything on and off stage all comes together. You have to be very detail-oriented but also see the big picture.

          <p>Wears many hats when working on a show, from safety manager to note-taker to motivational speaker. Stage management allows for one person to be an intermediary between the artistic, the technical and the logistical.</p>
          <p>At its core, stage management is about ensuring that everything runs smoothly from audition day to closing night. Whether it’s about making schedules, managing interpersonal relationships and building community, or making sure the lights change at just the right moment, every stage manager gets the pleasure of watching all the elements of their show intertwine and come to life. Sometimes stressful, often exciting and always rewarding, productions simply could not successfully happen without the stage manager.</p>

           <p>The ability to judge well is called discernment. Despite what the buy bull thumpers insists, the ability to judge is rational and correct and often can be the difference between the public embarrassment, physical accidents or even a tragic occurrences.</p>
           <p>Patience is a far superior intelligence than thinking. The ability to wait, in patience, is the most advanced intelligence in humans. You can be smart, whatever, but without intentional patience, you’d continue to be <span>ruled by events, emotions, and fashions</span>.</p>
           <p>Patience is the ultimate intelligence. Intentional patience is the ultimate mastery. May patience be with you!</p>
           <p>I've seen enough in this life to come to this realization; that the worst person you know, some of the worst [people] you know, and in many cases covertly, the worst people you know usually are surrounded by a very strong community that are really upholding and supporting them. People that are alone, people that have been ostracized or cast out by a group or are labelled in a way, usually I've come to overstand are not actually the ones that are the problem. There's this rhetoric that people who don't find themselves surrounded by so may people aren't, you know, in the middle of a community that uplifts them must automatically mean that there's something inherently wroung with that person. And I feel I've seen and seen enough now, so many instances and situations where the person who has been labelled, ostracized, and cast out is usually not the problem. The problem is usually the person that is in the center of that group.</p>

           <p>Fear is a manifestation of disorder. In Afurakani/Afuraitkaitnit culture we do not uphold fear as a virtue. We recognize fear to be a byproduct of immaturity and also as representing a lack of perception. Thus, we do not fear The Supreme Being, we respect The Supreme Being.</p>
           <p>Respect is a manifestation of Order. In Afurakani/Afuraitkaitnit culture we uphold respect as a virtue. We recognize it as a byproduct of maturity for it shows that we have fully developed our ability to perceive reality and operate accordingly.</p>
           <p>These concepts show the basis for respect (re-spect/re-view/re-look) being composed of terms related to perception, seeing, viewing, recognizing.</p>
           <p>Fere, meaning respect in Akan, embodies the ability to see (spect-) things, entities or events for what they really are, to see or perceive what our capacities are and to see how to interact with these things, entities or events, utilizing our spiritual capacities without creating or perpetuating disorder in the process. Fere is thus the act of proper recognition, hence the related term hu (to perceive by the eye, to behold, discern).</p>
           <p>Fere in the negative or misguided sense, manifesting as ehu (fear), means that we either mis-perceive some thing, entity or event and/or we properly perceive the thing, entity and/or event, yet do not properly perceive our capacity to harmoniously address or engage the thing, entity or event without creating disorder in the process. (Harmonious engagement could be acceptance or it could be rejecting, attacking, destroying to maintain Order). We thus develop a debilitating stress, because of our lack of proper recognition—we cannot see a harmonious outcome for ourselves. This debilitating stress blocks our perception yet further and also has a deleterious effect on our bodies, and ultimately our overall health. Frustration develops which often leads to self-destructive, rash behavior and/or misguided rationalizations which promote and lead to stagnation or self-destructive actions as well.</p>

           <p>A person who hides the truth already knows they're violating it. Don't let them gaslight you into thining they're sparing you. It's all about theirpersona. And yet, they tell on themselves in  glitches, bc the unconsciousis always speaking if you listen differently. You feel it first before you overstand it...</p>
           <p>The story they tell will start to feel a little diff, bc it fts to neatly; your body is going to tell you, no... something is missing, something
important.</p>
           <p>This is bc the body recognizes pattern and disruption before the mind does. You might not even have proof but just the knowing; and. most people ignore this. You were taught to be polite, take words at face value.
</p>
           <p>But when someone omits the truth beneath the level of language, it's in the tone, the subtle pauses, the carefully chosen rehearsed words. Your nervous system wil catch it before your mind can decode it...</p>
           <p>What most people don't realise...your nervous system is neuroceptively scanning for safety at all times. It's call neuroception, an unconscious process by which the body senses threats or deception before conscious awareness kicks in.</p>
           <p>You must own your mind as that is your true wealth. The true holy books are the understandings of the processes of hearing, smelling, seeing, touching and the creation of your feelings. The intelligence behind you being able to create those experiences, are just part of your huge number of abilities within, not appreciated yet, that all come together and enable you to create in your mind within what you call your life</p>
           <p>It has always been simple, you are the observer who cannot observe yourself, you can only observe your creations. That is why we refer to you as the creator or another word, God.</p>
