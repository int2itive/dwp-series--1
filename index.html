           <p>Let’s go.</p>
           <p>Buckle up! We’re going on a nervous system safari.</p>
           <p>We’re exploring the subtle ways your mind feels productive…while your body quietly avoids the work. Welcome to the trap of modern healing: If I talk about it, post about it, study it, consume 50 videos about it…maybe I won’t have to feel it.</p>
           <p>Spoiler: that’s not healing. Its the sneaky trap of performance.</p>
           <p>That’s sophisticated avoidance in disguise.</p>
           <p>Let’s be real it’s Monday. And a lot of people are planning to “get their life together” by starting another mental to-do list they won’t finish. Not because they’re lazy, but because procrastination is a form of control. If I delay the risk, I control the failure. If I don’t try, I don’t lose.</p>
           <p>We live in a world that confuses insight with integration. You don’t need more shadow work journals. You need to interrupt the loop in real time. To notice when your nervous system performs healing to protect you from the grief, the shame, the choice.</p>

           <p>Your Ancestors are not imaginary. All of your Ancestors walked on the Earth, and at some point were barefoot upon her. The Earth remembers each of them; their stories, their names, their faces, their tears, and their blood.</p>
           <p>Affectation</p>
           <p>A show, pretence, or display. Behaviour that is assumed rather than natural; artificiality. a particular habit, as of speech or dress, adapted to give a false impression. Affectation is planted into a person through some kind of deficit or traumatic experience that makes them feel the need to be proven with their actions or abilities. Rape, Molestation, Abandonment, Incest, Neglect, Talent Affirmations, etc.</p>
           <p>Needs constant affirmations because once this act is committed, the person reverts to feeling inhuman or strange. They must have the applause of people to feel normal or special.</p>
           <p>Don’t take anything personally. Nothing others do is because of you. What others say and/or do is a projection of their own reality. when you are immune to the opinions and/or actions of others, you won’t be the victim of needless suffering.</p>
           <p>“Culture is not, however, simply a compilation of ethnic heroes and holidays nor is it only awareness of other people’s music and dance.”</p>
           <p>Technically, culture is the vast structure of behaviors, ideas, attitudes, values, habits, beliefs, customs, language, rituals, ceremonies and practices peculiar to a particular group of people which provides them with a general design for living and patterns of interpreting reality.</p>
           <p>Culture gives meaning to reality. As such, culture has the power to compel behaviour and the capacity to reinforce ideas and beliefs about human functioning, including issues of educational achievement and motivation.</p>
           <p>As such, culture is the invisible medium in which all human functioning occurs. It is important to note, in fact, that nothing happens outside of culture…It is the stuff in which human development occurs.</p>
           <p>Culture is to humans as water is to fish. It is our total environment. As such, education as well as curriculum development are cultural phenomenon.</p>
           <p>Hence, just as the nature of water (i.e., salt vs. fresh vs. polluted) influences the reality (i.e survivability) of a particular type of fish, so too do different cultural systems influence the reality of particular groups of people.”</p>
           <p>The fact of the matter is that when we look at the notion of culture and raise the question of accessing children to a core curriculum, we should be very clear that the core curriculum itself is cultural; and that the teaching methodology that we utilize in teaching the core curriculum is cultural; and that the site leadership style is cultural, and that the guidance and counsel techniques are cultural, and that the instructional strategies are cultural, and that the school climate is cultural, and that ultimately the aim and purpose of education itself is cultural.</p>
           <p>In fact, if we understand the issue of culture, we should see that it is not a “social product” (i.e., something we can add on to what we are doing) and that culture is really a total human process. As the everything of human reality, culture in education becomes how we use the “spirit and the energy” of a people.</p>
           <p>However, since culture is essentially a process which gives a people a general design for living and patterns for interpreting reality, if the curricula is not consistent with the people’s general design for living and patterns for interpreting reality, then the curricula will also be inconsistent in its ability to guide the transmission of the intended information to reinforce the desire to learn and encourage internalization. (Teachers can’t transmit what they don’t know and don’t practice themselves).</p>
           <p>A code is simply the best way of doing something that undergoes constant refinement. Plumbing, Kung Foo, counter racism…a code is a code is a code.</p>
           <p>Let’s be real it’s Monday. And a lot of people are planning to “get their life together” by starting another mental to-do list they won’t finish. Not because they’re lazy, but because procrastination is a form of control. If I delay the risk, I control the failure. If I don’t try, I don’t lose.</p>
           <p>We live in a world that confuses insight with integration. You don’t need more shadow work journals. You need to interrupt the loop in real time. To notice when your nervous system performs healing to protect you from the grief, the shame, the choice.</p>
          <p>Boundary UP! Protect your peace, it’s very expensive; so do NOT give it away for FREE.</p>
          <p>Ghost them. They know what they do. No need to explain how they made you feel they didn’t care to wrong you just cut them off.</p>

           <p>What exists physically, exists first in thought and feeling; There is no other rule.</p>
           <p>There is absolutely no reason to Be-come upset over the use on the N-word. You didn’t create the word; and yet, you did create the sound. That sound has been misappropriated, and then played back to you with an amplified derogatory emphasis/inference; compressed into what might be regarded as its (a) meaning.</p>
           <p>Impostor Syndrome</p>
           <p>A psychological phenomenon in which a person is unable to internalize their accomplishments.</p>
           <p>Spoiler: you don’t need a squad… You absolutely need a circle; circle is all about information and guidance.</p>
           <p>If you just want to be an artist, don’t organize. Ask an organizer to organize for you. Be honest with yourself. Change often requires sacrifice of your work. If you don’t want to make that sacrifice, get some help so you can keep making your art.</p>
           <p>Don’t be scared of freedom. A lot of artists are crippled by freedom. They’re not used to support or opportunities that allow them to express themselves fully. Many of them have never taken the time to really dig into their craft as much as they’d like because of work or family or other commitments. When given an opportunity to really do what they do with no constraints, they respond by overcompensating or pulling punches in their work and deliver subpar art. This is fear, and fear is a beast. Even the baddest cat on the scene must sometimes contend with a fear of failure.</p>
           <p>The first way around this is to accept that fear is natural, like breathing.</p>
           <p>If you’re not scared you turn into that dude at open mic who thinks he’s the best cat in the room but is blind to the fact that he’s been performing to his girlfriend during a weed binge, so his take on things may be, shall we say, biased.</p>
           <p>The next thing you should do is get to work. Hit up the person who knows you and your work intimately enough that they can be honest with you about where your head is at. Let them in on your process. Show them what you’re doing.</p>
           <p><strong>Worrying is not the work.</strong></p>
           <p><strong>Thinking about the work is not the work.</strong></p>
           <p><strong>Work is the work.</strong></p>
           <p>Work your art like you work a job and you’ll have won half the battle.</p>
           <p>You must decide if everyone after you must pay the same dues you did or if they get to build off the dues you paid. The first answer is a loan on the status quo. The second answer is progress.</p>
           <p>Imposter syndrome is a real feeling, but not a real thing.</p>
           <p><strong>Ways We Handle Racism All Wrong</strong></p>          
           <p>I want to clarify, not so much the racism inherent in this specific case, but in the racism inherent in the request to constantly prove racial motive.</p>
           <p>Now, I can’t speak for all of your Black friends, but asking me to prove racism to you proves to me that you don’t know me. You can’t escape racism if you’re not white, and the more you know about it and how it operates just makes the condition worse. It’s ever-present, even when white people aren’t around, and it multiplies like cancer. It’s a disease that, if you stay ignorant of it, you could possibly (though rarely) save yourself a lot of the day-to-day emotional and mental grind such an existence presses into you until something happens, like pissing off someone like Ben Fields. Then it’s like getting inoperable stage-4 cancer all at once while having no insurance and no hospital will take you in. Increasing your knowledge about racism increases stress and all its attendant effects. It makes you less comfortable with your existence. It taints your rewards and successes. It amplifies your failures as a person and suggests there is nothing worthwhile in your people. Please note, all of this is true whether we’re talking about whites or people of color. Such is the persistent vigor of racism. The problem is that white people see racism as conscious hate, when racism is bigger than that. Racism is a complex system of social and political levers and pulleys set up generations ago to continue working on the behalf of whites at other people’s expense, whether whites know/like it or not. Racism is an insidious cultural disease. It is so insidious that it doesn’tcare if you are a white person who likes black people; it’s still going to find a way to infect how you deal with people who don’t look like you. Yes, racism looks like hate, but hate is just one manifestation. Privilege is another. Access is another. Ignorance is another. Apathy is another. And so on. So while I agree with people who say no one is born racist, it remains a powerful system that we’re immediately born into. It’s like being born into air: you take it in as soon as you breathe. It’s not a cold that you can get over. There is no anti-racist certification class. It’s a set of socioeconomic traps and cultural values that are fired up every time we interact with the world. It is a thing you have to keep scooping out of the boat of your life to keep from drowning in it. I know it’s hard work, but it’s the price you pay for owning everything. - scott woods</p>

           <p>The mechanics of our reality, is not in our hands, it is in our beliefs. Life is a choice we have been told, as long as we choose from the options given to us by the creators of the story.</p>
           <p>Guilt, fear, worship, the giving of yourself and hope, are the path on the road to nowhere. As heaven and hell are just enjoyed or disliked memories in our minds. The true path has always been an internal one.</p>
           <p>The mechanics of reality has only ever been in our minds, as the spirit within us has been the energy behind our experience of this reality.</p>
           <p>As the observer cannot observe itself, what you see is not you, it is merely what you have created in your mind to try and make sense of what you think.</p>
           <p>We create movies in our mind to enable us to design what we are going to do next. It has only been a waking dream, used by our minds, which we now refer to as our lives.</p>
           <p>Religion and most forms of spirituality, when focused on external gods or deities are teaching you to worship and not how to access the essence that is you. We are the observer, observing our thoughts, in our reality dreams, created within ourselves. The true understanding is within, as you begin to believe in you and not anything else.</p>
           <p>You must own your mind as that is your true wealth. The true holy books are the understandings of the processes of hearing, smelling, seeing, touching and the creation of your feelings. The intelligence behind you being able to create those experiences, are just part of your huge number of abilities within, not appreciated yet, that all come together and enable you to create in your mind within what you call your life</p>
           <p>It has always been simple, you are the observer who cannot observe yourself, you can only observe your creations. That is why we refer to you as the creator or another word, God.</p>

          <p>If you want to know someone's values, don't ask them what they love, watch what they're willing to delay, reorder, or relinquish. The human psyche organizes life around hierarchy. Where they place you within that system is who you are to them.</p>
          <p>Study patterns, not promises. The nervous system betrays a persons truth over time. They can swear loyalty with words, and yet their patterns will reveal their allegiance. Pattern is psychology. Watch where they return when life pressures them. A person can be wildly attracted to you and still betray you. They can be obsessed with you and still ababdon you. And yet, someone can't commit to you in integrity and simultaneously dishonour you.</p>
          <p>So many relationships start as distractions. Someone is still trying to soothe an ego, still bruised by an ex. Someone is trying to prove they are still desirable after being discarded. Someone is trying to silence the part of them that is terrified of being seen.</p> 
          <p><strong>"Nobody is trying to hear that thought..."</strong></p> 
          <p>And if you're not grounded, you'll confude their hunger for their heart. That's why situatioships exist. They are not accidents. And the reality is, you can be used beautifully. Someine can laught with you, hold you, sleep beside you, ans still not choose you. Because, you were recruited as a distraction.</p> 
          <p>That's why they ghost; why they go back to their ex. The connection was never about building with you, it was about soothing themselves.

          <p>As a stage manager, you are the logistics head of the body, making sure everything on and off stage all comes together. You have to be very detail-oriented but also see the big picture. It’s also important to anticipate any snags that could occur, be prepared and able to adjust as needed. Although event implementation is different, these skills are very important to event planning and management as well.</p>
          <p>Wears many hats when working on a show, from safety manager to note-taker to motivational speaker. Stage management allows for one person to be an intermediary between the artistic, the technical and the logistical.</p>
          <p>At its core, stage management is about ensuring that everything runs smoothly from audition day to closing night. Whether it’s about making schedules, managing interpersonal relationships and building community, or making sure the lights change at just the right moment, every stage manager gets the pleasure of watching all the elements of their show intertwine and come to life. Sometimes stressful, often exciting and always rewarding, productions simply could not successfully happen without the stage manager.</p>

           <p>I've seen enough in this life to come to this realization; that the worst person you know, some of the worst [people] you know, and in many cases covertly, the worst people you know usually are surrounded by a very strong community that are really upholding and supporting them. People that are alone, people that have been ostracized or cast out by a group or are labelled in a way, usually I've come to overstand are not actually the ones that are the problem. There's this rhetoric that people who don't find themselves surrounded by so may people aren't, you know, in the middle of a community that uplifts them must automatically mean that there's something inherently wroung with that person. And I feel I've seen and seen enough now, so many instances and situations where the person who has been labelled, ostracized, and cast out is usually not the problem. The problem is usually the person that is in the center of that group.</p>

           <p>Fear is a manifestation of disorder. In Afurakani/Afuraitkaitnit culture we do not uphold fear as a virtue. We recognize fear to be a byproduct of immaturity and also as representing a lack of perception. Thus, we do not fear The Supreme Being, we respect The Supreme Being.</p>
           <p>Respect is a manifestation of Order. In Afurakani/Afuraitkaitnit culture we uphold respect as a virtue. We recognize it as a byproduct of maturity for it shows that we have fully developed our ability to perceive reality and operate accordingly.</p>
           <p>These concepts show the basis for respect (re-spect/re-view/re-look) being composed of terms related to perception, seeing, viewing, recognizing.</p>
           <p>Fere, meaning respect in Akan, embodies the ability to see (spect-) things, entities or events for what they really are, to see or perceive what our capacities are and to see how to interact with these things, entities or events, utilizing our spiritual capacities without creating or perpetuating disorder in the process. Fere is thus the act of proper recognition, hence the related term hu (to perceive by the eye, to behold, discern).</p>
           <p>Fere in the negative or misguided sense, manifesting as ehu (fear), means that we either mis-perceive some thing, entity or event and/or we properly perceive the thing, entity and/or event, yet do not properly perceive our capacity to harmoniously address or engage the thing, entity or event without creating disorder in the process. (Harmonious engagement could be acceptance or it could be rejecting, attacking, destroying to maintain Order). We thus develop a debilitating stress, because of our lack of proper recognition—we cannot see a harmonious outcome for ourselves. This debilitating stress blocks our perception yet further and also has a deleterious effect on our bodies, and ultimately our overall health. Frustration develops which often leads to self-destructive, rash behavior and/or misguided rationalizations which promote and lead to stagnation or self-destructive actions as well.</p>

           <p>When problems are analysed with the essential focus on the negative, 
            the the solutions will invariaby be "reactions" rather than "actions." If 
            we look at what's wrong to the exlcusion of the model of success, health, and
            solutions, then the consequence will be a social theory written out of despair 
            and modelled on disturbances rather then Truth. Our concept of our experience 
            will be a constant state of correction rather than the restoration of an order 
            which affirms our progress as human beings. Human progress requires a vision. 
            This vision must be of an idealizwed form of how things ought to be, with the 
            focus on, "the best concept of the potential of the group involved."</p>
            <p>It must be based on a vivid and exalted concept of what those people 
            have been at their best. It must be drawn from a metaphysical concception 
            of the order of the Universe. It must incorporate the triumphs over encounters 
            with distorted life forms; and it must have a sustined conception of the
            resurrecting, regenerative, and trsnformative nature of human experience.</p>
           <p>But when someone omits the truth beneath the level of language, it's in the tone, the subtle pauses, the carefully chosen rehearsed words. Your nervous system wil catch it before your mind can decode it...</p>
           <p>What most people don't realise...your nervous system is neuroceptively scanning for safety at all times. It's call neuroception, an unconscious process by which the body senses threats or deception before conscious awareness kicks in.</p>
           <p>You must own your mind as that is your true wealth. The true holy books are the understandings of the processes of hearing, smelling, seeing, touching and the creation of your feelings. The intelligence behind you being able to create those experiences, are just part of your huge number of abilities within, not appreciated yet, that all come together and enable you to create in your mind within what you call your life</p>
           <p>It has always been simple, you are the observer who cannot observe yourself, you can only observe your creations. That is why we refer to you as the creator or another word, God.</p>

           <p>A person who hides the truth already knows they're violating it. Don't let them gaslight you into thining they're sparing you. It's all about their
persona. And yet, they tell on themselves in  glitches, bc the unconscious
is always speaking if you listen differently. You feel it first before you overstand it...</p>
           <p>The story they tell will start to feel a little diff, bc it fts to neatly; your body is going to tell you, no... something is missing, something
important.</p>
           <p>This is bc the body recognizes pattern and disruption before the mind does. You might not even have proof but just the knowing; and. most people ignore this. You were taught to be polite, take words at face value.

           <p>To be the son of a preacher man was once African American cultural royalty. As traditional churches have grown empty many of us have been left to wander these haunted castles like that displaced Prince of Denmark, contemplating the paths of our mothers: that electric lady that landed us here in the first place. The Aquarian Age is a matriarchal age, and if we are to exist as men in this new world many of us must learn to embrace and nuture that which is feminine with all of our hearts (he-arts). But is there any room for artistry in hip hop’s decadent man-sion? Have we walked our Timberlands soleless…soul-less? When you pour that wine on the ground in that video shoot that has become your life will you be ready to hear the voice that pours from the bottle to inebriate the very ground on which we walk? It is libations such as these that are the start of every voodoo ceremony. And let us not forget that that is why we have come.</p>
           <p>We have come in the name of Jimi, Sly, Marvin, Stevie, all artists formerly known as spirits and all spirits formerly known as stars. We have come in the tradition of burning bushes, burning ghettos, burning splifs, and the ever-burning candles of our bedrooms and silent chambers. We have come bearing instruments and our voices: Falsetto and baritone, percussion and horns. We have come adorned in the apparel of the anointed: leather and feathers, jeans and t-shirts, linen and cashmere, and even polyester. We have come to seduce and serenade the night and the powers of darkness. We speak of darkness, not as ignorance, but as the unknown and the mysterious of the unseen.</p>
           <p>Envision this: a lone man in a haunted room surrounded by glowing instructments. What sounds are evoked from a room where Jimi once slept? What are the rewards of those who tend to their God-given talents as they would have the Creator tend to their spirits and daily lives? What happens when the artist becomes the conjur man?</p>
           <p>These are questions that seem to be null and void in the face of all the glitter and glamour that has dominated most successful Black artistry of recent years. We seem to be more preoccupied with cultivating our bank accounts than cultivating our crafts. Nowadays, I find my peers more inspired by an artist’s business tactics than their artistry. In fact, we do not seem to mind an artistry that suffers in the face of seemingly good business. More artists seem to yearn to own their own labels, etc., than they seem to yearn to master their crafts. No, we cannot allow any more Bessie Smiths to occur, but once an artist owns their own publishing the question then becomes, what are you going to publish? Of course, I am using the word “artist” loosely. I, personally, believe in an art as it exists in the context of the phrase “thou art God”. In this phrase, art is the word that connects the individual (thou) to their higher self (God) or to that which is universal. Using such a standard, most emcees might become embarrassed.</p>
           <p>Whoa! Why am I attacking hip hop? ‘Cause I’m a lyricist, son, a lyricist that has had to serve as his own inspiration when most of my peers seem to idolize Donald Trump more than Sly Stone, when they don’t seem to realize that Jimi Hendrix was and is a sonic Bill gates. Oh shit, don’t make me call no names.</p>
           <p>Now, you may ask, “Well what does this have to do with D’Angelo?” My answer: <strong>Inspiration</strong>.</p>
           <p>Here is a peer that is focused wholly on his craft and has given himself the challenge of bettering himself. I mean really, D could have come out with any ol’ follow-up album after Brown Sugar dropped so that he could double his sales “While he’s still hot.” You know, an album that sounds just like Brown Sugar, uses all the same formulas, so that audiences don’t have to think ….or grown, they just keep liking the same shit. He could even sample songs that you’re already familiar with so that you don’t have to go through the “hard work” of getting used to a new melody or bass line. Y’all don’t hear me.</p>
           <p>You might respond, “Lyrics? Yo, I can’t even understand half the shit that D’Angelo be saying. That nigga sounds like Bobby McFerrin on opium.” And I’d say, “You’re right. Neither can I. But I am drawn to figure out what it is that he’s saying. His vocal collaging intrigues me.” Or you might say, “But his shit don’t sound all that original, he just sounds like he’s trying to be Prince or some shit.” And I’d say, maybe you’re right. At times he does. We often study the breathing techniques of our inspirations (inspire means to breathe in or to make breath, inhale). And that’s also true for most of you, emcees. I mean, don’t ¾ of y’all niggas sound like NAS? The difference is that D’Angelo has allowed influence to simply take its place among his own intuitive artistry. He works to find his own voice within his many influences. I’d pay to see Prince’s face as he listens to this album (Ahmir, ? of The Roots, said that the Artist lets Black people call him Prince). Do you think he’d feel robbed or inspired? My opinion, over the years as I’ve sat in countless conversations about why it is that the Artist puts out half the shit he does (you know the half I’m talking about) is because he lacks any new inspiration. Once again an artist is faced with the reality of having to serve as their own inspiration after they have worn out all their Sly, Jimi, Marvin, Stevie ( I do not mean to ignore the many inspirational female singers, I’m just making a point as regards this male vocalist)…</p>
           <p>Damn, is there any way to speak of that which is feminine without having masculinity right in the middle of it? Female. Woman. Unless, of course, these words came first and we later dervied male and man from them. Somehow, I doubt that. We need a new language to go along with this new age. And a new music.</p>
           <p>Thus, we have come. As we prepare to journey, we must decide which elements of our sonic past we are going to pack to carry with us into this new day this new sound. The distilled ambiance of an Al Green song, the ambiguous sexual majesty of a Prince song, the creative genius of Stevie Wonder…D’Angelo has made his choices, carefully weaving them into his character, and has courageously stepped into the void bearing these sonic offerings to be delivered to the beckoning goddess of the new age. I do not wish to overly dissect this album. It’s true dissection occurs in how it seeps into your life shapes your moments. What you were doing when you realized he was saying this or that? How it played softly in the back ground when you first saw him or her. How you kept it on repeat on that special night. You’ll see. These songs are incantations, testaments of artistry, confessions of an Aquarius as he steps into his own.</p>
