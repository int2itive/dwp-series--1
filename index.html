      <p>As a stage manager, you are the logistics head of the body, making sure everything on and off stage all comes together. You have to be very detail-oriented but also see the big picture. It’s also important to anticipate any snags that could occur, be prepared and able to adjust as needed. Although event implementation is different, these skills are very important to event planning and management as well.</p>
      <p>Wears many hats when working on a show, from safety manager to note-taker to motivational speaker. Stage management allows for one person to be an intermediary between the artistic, the technical and the logistical.</p>
      <p>At its core, stage management is about ensuring that everything runs smoothly from audition day to closing night. Whether it’s about making schedules, managing interpersonal relationships and building community, or making sure the lights change at just the right moment, every stage manager gets the pleasure of watching all the elements of their show intertwine and come to life. Sometimes stressful, often exciting and always rewarding, productions simply could not successfully happen without the stage manager.</p>
