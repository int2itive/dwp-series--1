          <!--<p>Since It's Motivated That Means It's Coming Back Around.</p>-->
           <p>The mechanics of our reality, is not in our hands, it is in our beliefs. Life is a choice we have been told, as long as we choose from the options given to us by the creators of the story.</p>
           <p>Guilt, fear, worship, the giving of yourself and hope, are the path on the road to nowhere. As heaven and hell are just enjoyed or disliked memories in our minds. The true path has always been an internal one.</p>
           <p>The mechanics of reality has only ever been in our minds, as the spirit within us has been the energy behind our experience of this reality.</p>
           <p>As the observer cannot observe itself, what you see is not you, it is merely what you have created in your mind to try and make sense of what you think.</p>
           <p>We create movies in our mind to enable us to design what we are going to do next. It has only been a waking dream, used by our minds, which we now refer to as our lives.</p>
           <p>Religion and most forms of spirituality, when focused on external gods or deities are teaching you to worship and not how to access the essence that is you. We are the observer, observing our thoughts, in our reality dreams, created within ourselves. The true understanding is within, as you begin to believe in you and not anything else.</p>
           <p>You must own your mind as that is your true wealth. The true holy books are the understandings of the processes of hearing, smelling, seeing, touching and the creation of your feelings. The intelligence behind you being able to create those experiences, are just part of your huge number of abilities within, not appreciated yet, that all come together and enable you to create in your mind within what you call your life</p>
           <p>It has always been simple, you are the observer who cannot observe yourself, you can only observe your creations. That is why we refer to you as the creator or another word, God.</p>

          <p>As a stage manager, you are the logistics head of the body, making sure everything on and off stage all comes together. You have to be very detail-oriented but also see the big picture. It’s also important to anticipate any snags that could occur, be prepared and able to adjust as needed. Although event implementation is different, these skills are very important to event planning and management as well.</p>
          <p>Wears many hats when working on a show, from safety manager to note-taker to motivational speaker. Stage management allows for one person to be an intermediary between the artistic, the technical and the logistical.</p>
          <p>At its core, stage management is about ensuring that everything runs smoothly from audition day to closing night. Whether it’s about making schedules, managing interpersonal relationships and building community, or making sure the lights change at just the right moment, every stage manager gets the pleasure of watching all the elements of their show intertwine and come to life. Sometimes stressful, often exciting and always rewarding, productions simply could not successfully happen without the stage manager.</p>

           <p>Fear is a manifestation of disorder. In Afurakani/Afuraitkaitnit culture we do not uphold fear as a virtue. We recognize fear to be a byproduct of immaturity and also as representing a lack of perception. Thus, we do not fear The Supreme Being, we respect The Supreme Being.</p>
           <p>I've seen enough in this life to come to this realization; that the worst person you know, some of the worst [people] you know, and in many cases covertly, the worst people you know usually are surrounded by a very strong community that are really upholding and supporting them. People that are alone, people that have been ostracized or cast out by a group or are labelled in a way, usually I've come to overstand are not actually the ones that are the problem. There's this rhetoric that people who don't find themselves surrounded by so may people aren't, you know, in the middle of a community that uplifts them must automatically mean that there's something inherently wroung with that person. And I feel I've seen and seen enough now, so many instances and situations where the person who has been labelled, ostracized, and cast out is usually not the problem. The problem is usually the person that is in the center of that group.</p>
